    <h2>The Indian Education System: Growth, Challenges, and the Student Perspective</h2>

    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      Education is the backbone of a nation. In the last decade, India has seen
      major growth in education — from IITs and IIMs to government schools.
    </p>

    <p>
      For students, education is not just marks or degrees. It is about dreams,
      pressure, and hope.
    </p>

    <h3>Growth of IITs and IIMs</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>More IIT and IIM campuses</li>
      <li>Better research and global recognition</li>
      <li>Opportunities beyond metro cities</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Getting into these institutes is a dream built on sacrifice and hard work.
    </p>

    <h3>Government Schools: The Backbone</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Mid-Day Meal Scheme</li>
      <li>Digital classrooms</li>
      <li>Teacher training programs</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      For rural students, government schools are a lifeline to a better future.
    </p>

    <h3>Education as a Business</h3>
    <p>
      Coaching centers and online platforms have turned education into an
      industry.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>High competition and pressure</li>
      <li>Unequal access to quality education</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Student Perspective</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Happiness in success</li>
      <li>Stress from competition</li>
      <li>Hope to change family life</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      India’s education system has grown, but students still carry emotional
      pressure. Growth must focus on equality and mental well-being.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Education is not a system — it is a dream.</strong> 📚🇮🇳</p>
